<p style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 12px; color: #8c8c8c; border-top: 1px solid #E0E0E0;">You can only apply for PCDL cover 8 weeks or less prior to the start of the course until the end date. It can take from 1 to 6 weeks to process your application.<br><br>There are various funding options available to students aged 18+. Professional and Career Development Loans are commercial bank loans that can be used to help pay for work related learning. You can borrow between £300 and £10,000 to help support the cost of up to two years of learning (or three years if it includes one year’s relevant unpaid practical work). The  Government will pay the interest on the loan while you are training and for one month afterwards. You will then need to start repaying the loan as you would any other commercial loan product. The loan can be used to pay course fees or other costs such as travel and living expenses. You can also use the loan to supplement other forms of support such as grants or bursaries. As the Professional and Career Development Loan is a commercial loan product, you should make sure you have investigated all the funding options that may be open to you to ensure you make an  informed decision about whether the loan is right for you.
